react-> is a library of JS -> for creating UI

FrameWork -> we cant change the set of rules
Library -> we can change the accordingly

react uses -> web development      -> react js
           -> mobile development   -> react native

Jorden walk is the founder of react in 2011 (dependend)
in 2013 it was open source

sections are called as -> componts
previously we use to write all the code for all the sections
but in react we use to make one file and the we will do import export to call that section
the main advantage of react is reusability

State -> the data can be changed is called as state which is present inside the tags

What is diffing?
it is use to change the content with the help of react without targeting 
it is also the comparision of real dom and virtual dom (copy of real dom)
Difference between virtual dom and real dom 

we use bundler to make the project (react + bundler)
vite -> is the bundler we use 

What is bundler? 

we use cmd to react project 
the command is -> npm create vite@latest

the select all the command

then the project will run in the server 
to close it we will use ctrl+c

to run it again we use the command in the project folder -> npm run dev 

first we have to go to the project directory -> cd project name
then we have to install the node module -> npm install
then we have to run it -> npm run dev

inside the folder -:

node module -> all the package were install in thei folder
public -> no file will be changed in this folder
src -> we will work in this folder and we will make the componts hear
.gitignore ->
package.json -> all the entries of the project were present in this file
package-lock.json -> all the dependecies were lock in this file with virsion with path to run it in the future
vite.config.js -> saves the vite configiration 

VVIP -> there will be only one html file

.jsx -> javascript xml
xml -> extensible markup language

rules of jsx -> 
1. There will be one parent element and multiple child
2. 

in this the main.jsx will work like a medium which will make the componts present 
in the app.jsx to show in the browser with the help of index.html

app.jsx is the root componts

there are 2 types of componts
1. class componts
2. funtional componts  -> is the latest we use

to export multiple function we use named export

if we want to write the code of so we will write the 
code outside of the return 

we use css in 2 ways 1. Inline 
                     2. External

in inline css we pass the style and the 2 curly bracket
<h1 style={{css}}>

to apply css in perticular file we will write External css in 
app.jsx

and if we want to apply css globaly so we will write css code in index.jsx

to write css in external we use to import the css file to the file in which we have to apply

Props->
Props Are called as properties and it is the combination attributes and parameter
it will flow the data from parent to child

attributes are called as additional properties of tags

we will pass the attribute in the parent
and we will accept that attribute through the parameter in the child

tags which we will write in the return function are called as JSX

Props are static & immutable

if we transfer data from one page to another this is called as Props Drilling,

if we want to add image to the webpage through jsx so there is 
2 ways 

1. from the public which we will use directly
2. from assets which we have to import from the assets folder through passing the variable in the app.jsx

step to install tailwind are as follow

1. we have to copy command from the tailwin site 
2. then we will come to the second and paste in the vite.config.js
3. the we will copy the css command and paste it to the index.css
4. the we will run it

to use tailwind we have to learn some function

Events-> function to make the funcionality are called as events.

When we have to pass some value at the calling time then we have to pass the arrow function at the calling time and pass the +a at the function

the data change in the JSX are called as state

Hooks-> Hooks are predefine function 
Syntax->let[variable,function]=useState(Initial state)

if we want to change the value of that useState then we will
have to take the help of that function only which we have given in that variable

hook will be made in the top of the componts & starting of that function
and we will have to import it
